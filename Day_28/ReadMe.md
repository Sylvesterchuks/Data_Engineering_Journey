## Day 28: Frequently used Linux Commands in Data engineering.
Learnt more use cases of Linux command, how to use Linux commands in navigating, handling, manipulating of files and directories and granting of access and permission to files and directories.

🗜 Navigating the File System:
- Linux facilitates seamless navigation through the file system, allowing users to move between directories, check contents, and traverse the directory structure efficiently using commands like cd, ls, pwd, and tree.

🗂 Managing Files and Directories:
- It enables users to create, copy, move, rename, delete files, and directories, providing essential file management capabilities via commands like mkdir, cp, mv, rm, and rmdir.

⛓ Data Extraction and Transfer:
- Linux simplifies data extraction and transfer by supporting various tools and commands like grep, awk, sed, and tar, facilitating the extraction of specific data from files or streams and transferring data between systems.

🛠 Text Processing and Manipulation:
- It offers powerful text processing and manipulation capabilities using commands such as cut, sort, uniq, and tr, enabling users to extract, transform, and manipulate text content efficiently.

📟 Monitoring and Debugging:
- Linux provides tools for system monitoring and debugging, allowing users to monitor system performance, diagnose issues, and manage processes using commands like ps, top, kill, and htop.

🔐 User Management and Permissions:
- It grants administrators the ability to manage user accounts, modify permissions, and set access rights through commands like su, chmod, chown, etc.
