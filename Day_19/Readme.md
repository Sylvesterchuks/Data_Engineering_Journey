## Day 19: Data Ingestion with Pandas

Today, I continued my data engineering journey by learning how to use the pandas library to streamline the data ingestion process on Datacamp platform. Pandas is a powerful Python library that is widely used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides a variety of functions for loading data from a variety of sources, including flat files, spreadsheets, relational databases, JSON files, and APIs.

**I learnt:**
<p>ðŸ“Œ how to load data from flat files, such as CSV files. Pandas provides the read_csv() function for this purpose.</p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ how to load data from spreadsheets, such as Excel files. Pandas provides the read_excel() function for this purpose.</p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ how to create database engine using sqlalchemy and load data from relational databases. Pandas provides the read_sql() function and read_sql_query() function for this purpose.</p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ how to load data from JSON files. Pandas provides the read_json() function for this purpose.</p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ how to load data from APIs. Pandas does not provide a built-in function for this purpose, so I used the requests library to make API calls and then load the data into a pandas DataFrame using the read_json() function.</p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ In addition I learnt how to use json_normalize function for flattening Nested JSONs.</p>

I am excited to continue learning more about pandas and its vast application.
