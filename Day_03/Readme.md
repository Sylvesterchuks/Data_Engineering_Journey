## Day 3: Difference between a Data Engineer, Data Analyst and a Data Scientist.
Data engineers focus mainly on building data pipelines, data ingestion, and preparing data for data analytics project. However, data engineers work very closely with data scientists, data analysts, software engineers etc. and share a set of common skill sets with these various roles, thus it’s not rare that a data engineer is confused with other roles e.g. Data scientists, software engineers.

I learnt about the difference between these roles and their major responsibilities, by reading this article “What is a Data Engineer” by [WeCloudData](https://www.linkedin.com/company/weclouddata/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BPwSyTx4eRkm0nYyHFq8k4Q%3D%3D) and “Data Roles Explained” written by [Chisom C.

It’s also important to note that these roles often overlap, depending on the organization. In smaller teams, one person might perform across multiple roles. As the field evolves, the distinctions between these roles may also shift, but the core responsibilities remain consistent.
