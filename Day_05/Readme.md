## Day 5: Some of the Skills used by Data Engineers.

Learnt about some of the data engineering skills. The skills needed by a data engineer, can be categorized into technical, functional, and soft skills.

#### Technical skills.
⭐Query languages for accessing and manipulating data in a database, such as SQL for relational databases and SQL-like query languages for NoSQL databases.
⭐Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java.
⭐Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell.
⭐Familiarity with Big Data processing tools such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark.
⭐Knowledge of infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, networking, and application services, such as load balancing and application performance monitoring. Also, cloud-based services such as those offered by Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
⭐Experience of working with databases which include: RDBMSs such as IBM DB2, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4J.
⭐Data warehouses such as Oracle Exadata, Amazon RedShift, Snowflake.
⭐Ability to work with data pipelines. Popular data pipeline solutions include Apache Beam, AirFlow.

#### Functional Skills:
🌟The ability to convert business requirements into technical specifications.
🌟The ability to work with the complete software development lifecycle which includes ideation, architecture, design, prototyping, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
🌟An understanding of data’s potential application in business.
🌟An understanding of the risks of poor data management which essentially covers data quality, privacy, security, and compliance.

#### Soft Skills:
🤝 Data engineering is a team sport.
