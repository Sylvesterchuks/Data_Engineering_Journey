## Day 23: Creating and Working with a Database

![Data Modelling](1699818724744.jpg)

After learning MySQL Database Administration on Maven Analytics, I was eager to practice my SQL skills in creating, populating, altering and deleting of databases and tables. I decided to practice with the Maven Space Mission Challenge dataset, which contains all the space missions in human history.
<p>The dataset was in CSV format, with over 4,630 records. Each record contained information such as the mission name, location, date, launch status, company responsible, and rocket information.</p>
<p>üìù I started by creating a database called "mavenspacemission" and a table called "allmissions." I used the same number of columns as the CSV file, with an initial VARCHAR datatype for most of the columns except for dates and times.</p>

<p>üì• Tried to load the CSV file using the Data Import Wizard, but it was only able to load 2,970 records. I then decided to use the "Load Data" method, which was able to load the entire dataset.</p>

<p>‚ùÑ Did a sketch of the data model and relationship.</p>

<p>üåì Used the SELECT statement to retrieve subsets of the records and created four more tables: locations, rocketinfo, company, and missions. I then created primary keys for each table and referenced them as foreign keys in the fact table.</p>

<p>üîó To visualize the relationships between the tables, I generated an ER diagram from a script and then forward engineered the ER diagram to a script.</p>

<p>üì§ Finally, I exported the dump structure and data to a SQL script and loaded the SQL script to create and populate all the tables.</p>

**Some of the Problems encountered and solutions:**
<ol>
<li>Error Code: 1366. Incorrect DECIMAL value: '0' for column '' at row -1. Problem is strict sql mode is enabled, and you try to pass NULL or empty string as value for decimal fields, check link for solution: https://lnkd.in/gT4d8QtE</li>
<li>Error Code: 3948. Loading local data is disabled; this must be enabled on both the client and server sides. Problem: LOCAL_INFILE is disabled, check link for solution: https://lnkd.in/geNMRAdZ</li>
<li>Error Code: 2068. LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE file request rejected due to restrictions on access. Problem: Access restriction, check link for solution: https://lnkd.in/g-i5P_rx</li>
</ol>
