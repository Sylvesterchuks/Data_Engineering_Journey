## Day 1: Why Data Engineering is important?
Businesses produce lots of data. Everything from customer feedback to sales performance and stock price influences how a company operates.  Data is made available in a variety of structured and unstructured formats, residing in text, images, videos, clickstreams, user conversations, social media platforms, the Internet of Things (or IoT) devices, real-time events that stream data, legacy databases, and data sourced from professional data providers and agencies. 

Over the years these sources keep getting more diverse and dynamic, becoming more difficult to understand or make sense of the data, so businesses rely on DATA ENGINEERING to collect, clean, combine, and transform it into a usable format and make it available to other stakeholders e.g., Data Analysts, Data Scientists etc.

In Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Joe Reis & Matt Housley defined DATA ENGINEERING as the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. And a DATA ENGINEER manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
