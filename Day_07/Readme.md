## Day 7: Python Programming Basics Continues

Data handling in python requires you to have good knowledge of datatypes. Data types in Python can be grouped into mutable and immutable types. Today I refreshed my knowledge on some datatypes in Python and their inbuilt functions for data handling. Areas covered includes:
<ul>
<li>✏ String formatting</li>
<li>✏ String functions e.g., contains, startswith, replace, split, strip, isalnum, endswith</li>
<li>✏ List functions e.g., count, sort, append, insert, extend, pop/push, index</li>
<li>✏ Set functions e.g., intersection, difference, union, symmetric_difference, issubset, remove</li>
<li>✏ Dictionary functions e.g., get, update, pop, clear, popItem, items</li>
<li>✏ Accessing elements in a String, List and Tuple through indexing and slicing; accessing elements in sets through loops; and dictionaries using keys.</li>
</ul>
