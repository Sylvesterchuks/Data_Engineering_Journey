## Day 8: Recap on Python functions

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. In Python there are two basic types of functions; Standard library functions and User-defined functions. Standard library functions are built-in functions in Python that are available to use.
Some example of built-in functions include: print function, input function, len function, type function etc. User-defined functions are functions we created to solve specific problem.
To define or declare a function, Python provides the def keyword. The following is the syntax for defining a function.

NB: The function block of code is executed only when the function is called or invoked.
