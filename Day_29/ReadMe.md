Below is an overview of all the steps involved:

ðŸ”µ Importing python libraries.

ðŸ”µ Creating utils functions making modular and code reusable.

ðŸ”µ Reading data from CSV into dataframes.

ðŸ”µ Performing data cleaning and transformation: Selecting subset of data, Changing columns to lowercase and replacing spaces between columns with underscore, Viewing and checking data types, Printing out invalid values in columns, Handling invalid values and changing data types.

ðŸ”µ Creating connections and creating database

ðŸ”µ Creating tables

ðŸ”µ Inserting multiple values into tables

ðŸ”µ Validating data insertion

ðŸ”µ Closing the Connection
 
The detailed steps taken can be found in the pdf file.
