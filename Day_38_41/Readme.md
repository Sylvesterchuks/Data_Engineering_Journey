##### Installation
<hr>
On your local machine open gitbash and create a folder named weather_etl

    mkdir service_request_etl
Change to the created directory

    cd service_request_etl/
Create a virtual environment

    python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment

    source venv/Scripts/activate
    
Clone the git repository

    git clone https://github.com/Sylvesterchuks/Data_Engineering_Journey.git
    
Change to the directory containing our scripts

    cd Data_Engineering_Journey/Day_38_41/
    
Run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all Python packages and their dependencies neede for this task inside the virtual environment.
    
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```
    nano .env

Run the below command to get the correct path into scrpaer.bat, then add the batch file to windows task scheduler to automate the ETL process.

    drive=$(echo `pwd` | cut -d / -f2)
    sed -i 's\path\'$(pwd)'\g' scraper.bat && sed -i 's\/'"$drive"'/\'"$drive"':\g' scraper.bat
