**🛠 DDL — Data Definition Language: Commands [CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE]**
DDL commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and constraints.
-  ✏ CREATE is used to create a new database, table or view.
-  ✏ ALTER is used to modify an existing table’s structure.
-  ✏ Drop used to delete a database, table, view.
-  ✏ TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.

-  🗝 GRANT: Used to grant specific privileges to database users or roles.
-  🔒 REVOKE: Used to revoke previously granted privileges.

**📝 DML — Data Manipulation Language: Commands [INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE]**
